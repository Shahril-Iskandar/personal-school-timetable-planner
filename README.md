# SSM-Timetable-Planner
What is this about?

This is a personal project to allow myself to plan university courses visually; by following NTU STARS format that allows for dropdown option and display in calendar format. It is also able to  export to Google calendar format.

Problem that inspire me to this:
NIE provides semester timetable in PDF format which makes it hard to visualise the day/time of week for that particular course. NTU STARS allows students to tentatively add courses into their planner and visualise it in a nicer way. So this project aims to do just that with a combination of Python and Excel VBA.

How?

Download file `Module1.bas` and follow guide on `Instructions.ipynb`to run code on `main.ipynb`.

*CAVEAT:

If there is more than 1 day shown in the 'Day' column of the timetable given, the 2nd day will be removed. You will have to add it manually, otherwise it will not be available in the dropdown.
